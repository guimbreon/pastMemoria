        <h2>Don't handle your love to a random man</h2>
        <p>
            This story is just a sad tale about a sad woman who got poisoned by her own love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her name started with an “I”. She was my grandma, a tiny little woman with a big attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            Daughter of a numerous family, the youngest, the smallest, a pretty face without a name, just the shadow of her older sister, the prime version of her.
        </p>
        <p>
            She grew up in a hungry house, no food, no pavements, no ceiling, just an empty stomach and an empty heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day she met a man, slightly older.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that moment all that she could breathe was his words, as if he was the one and only representation of God’s desire.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that moment her heart was tied up with his wills, she only knew she was living because she could physically feel the love for him running through her veins. She had a life ahead, she was young, but she was completely devoted to him, she could die in that precise moment, nothing mattered if that was what he wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            They married, of course, as a beautiful fairy tale should end, “happily ever after.”
        </p>
        <p>
            She just didn't know that her nightmare had just started.
        </p>
        <p>
            This man was violent, he used to bleed his love through his fists, except the blood wasn't his.
        </p>
        <p>
            She thought it was normal, it was just his way of finding fulfillment in the great feeling of love, through violence.
        </p>
        <p>
            They married and they had children, seven if I’m being precise. The last one, the youngest being my father.
        </p>
        <p>
            On that day, in 1969, my grandma saw the love of her life die from cancer in the same hospital, at the exact same time that her newborn baby was passing through the tunnel of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time was the same on the birth and death certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that moment she died too, she was all alone with seven children, with no job and no studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was all alone, surrounded by poverty and skeletal children, living literally inside a pigsty covered with cement.
        </p>
        <p>
            She never gave up.
        </p>
        <p>
            With lots of effort, many years after her love died, many hours of slavery work, everything was starting to recover inside, her kids were getting older, stronger, she was feeling like she did make it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly a glass shattered in her heart, again. Her boy, her firstborn boy had just died. He lost a fight against cancer too, against drugs, against himself, he let the Devil be smarter and won the lottery of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now, she was alone all over again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everybody left, her kids were adults now, she was getting older and older, getting grandkids and great-grandkids, surrounded by ghosts and the fact that she was nearly a ghost among the living too.
        </p>
        <p>
            My grandma married her love at 17, lost him 20 years later and never married again, never had anyone again.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was never the perfect man, he was aggressive, possessive, broke her nose, left her bleeding on the floor multiple times but she never doubted her love for him. Why? I guess I’ll never know.
        </p>
        <p>
            She passed away at 90 years old from natural causes.
        </p>
        <p>
            On her last days alive she repeated multiple times that she knew that grandpa was waiting for her and that he would come and get her.
        </p>
        <p>
            She never stopped loving him even after more than 70 years. Sometimes she said that she couldn’t remember his face completely but she knew that she still loved him as if she had just met him.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last thing that she said to me before being gone was “don’t handle your love to a random man.” She knew what she was talking about…
